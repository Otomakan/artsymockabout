Graph Systems: Composed of Node and Edge. Example of a graph system You can have weighed ones or not.

Dijkstra's Algorithm and A# are Search algorithms. for wieghted algorithms. BFS for search ones

Search Algorithms:

Binary Search Tree: Methods that allow to move through data structure. 
tree where each node has two connections.  Choose a random number as the root. If less than left node , if more right node. 

Breadth First Search: Looking at the clostest elements then the ones closest to them until we find what we want


A* uses heuristics (educated guess) we ake a guess on what route will probably be the best.
f(n) = g(n) +h(n)
h = heuristic guess to get to the end
g = actual 'cost' from beggining to end
f is the cost function form getting from point A to point b
