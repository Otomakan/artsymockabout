  	<quote>The geometric point is an invisible thing. Therefore, it must be deffined as an incorporeal thing. Considered in terms of substance, it equals zero.<br/>
  		Hidden in this zero, however, are various attributes whiche are "human" in nature". We think of this zero in relation to the greatest possible brevity, i.e, to the highest degree of restraint which, nevertheless, speaks.
  		<br/>
  		<span>Thus we look upon the geometric point as the ultimate and most singular union of silence and speech</span>
  		<br>
  		In the flow of speech, the point symbolizeds interruption, non-existence (negative element), and at the same time it forms a bridge from one existence to another (positive element). In this writing, this constitutes its <span>inner significance</span>
  	</quote>
  	<p> in the flow of any sentence used in every day life the point has a traditional sound, </p><quote> which is mute</quote>
  		<quote> the sound of that silence customarily conected with the point is so emphatic that it overshadows the other characteristics.</quote>
  		<quote> we are surrounded by silence</quote>
  	<quote>[...]one makes discoveries in the everyday life[...]the lifeless signs turn into living sumbols and the dead is revived.</quote>
  	<quote>Naturally, the new science of art can only debvelop when the signs become symbols and the receptive eye and ear open the qay from silence to speech.</quote>
  	<h4>Release</h4>As we observe the point outside of our bias, we release it from the its boring shackles and give it a voice. We can hear more and more distincly the <span>inner tensions</span> It battles with.<br/>
  	<div id="today-i-am-going-to-the-movies-container">
  		<div id="today-i-am-going-to-the-movies">
  		Today I am going to the movies.<br/>
  		Today I am going. To the movies<br/>
  		Today I. Am going to the movies<br/>
  		</div>
  	</div>
  	The point has an intention, it carries meaning, leads to conclusions, controls origins and destinations (as absurd as they may be ie: sentence N3).
  	<br>
  	What happens if we let the point go against its grammatical nature?
  	<div id="goodbye-point">

  		<div id="goodbye-point-text">

  		Today I am going to the movies
  			 <div id="goodbye-point-point">
  			        &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;.

  	<quote>As the surrounding space and the size of the point are increased, the sound of the print is reduces and the sound of the point becomes clearer and more powerful. </quote>

  	<quote>This is a useless, revolutionary state of affaires</quote>
  	<h4>Independant Being</h4>
  	<quote> It begins its life as an independent being and its subordination transforms itself into a innerpurposeful one. this is the world of painting</quote>
  	<h4>Through Collision</h4>
  	<p> The point is the result of the collison of the tool with the material plane. In computers, is it the collision of the binary number with the hardware? Our fingers with the keyboard? ...</p>
  	<h4>Concept</h4>
  	<p>the point as an external concept in painting is hard to define. It must have a certain size, some sort of hard to define boundaries and yet be clearly separate from other structures. The proportions are also an extremely important element: to the plane and other shapes. </p>
